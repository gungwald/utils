Can't resolve .local hosts
	- nslookup, host, dig - only query DNS, not mDNS, /etc/hosts, other any other
	- resolvectl mdns - claims there is no mdns lookup active, which is wrong
	  It is wrong because resolvectl only queries the setup of systemd-resolved(.service)
	  not the real setup which is in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
	- getent hosts woolly-rhino.local - Test name resolution of glibc which is 
	  configured via /etc/nsswitch.conf
	  Even though mdns_minimal is on the hosts line of /etc/nsswitch.conf, it still
	  doesn't work
	- The nss-mdns package has to be installed - still doesn't work
	- Need to configure firewall: 
		sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=mdns
		sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=mdns --permanent
	- Still doesn't work - need to start the service. It is enabled by install but not
	  started.....duh....
		sudo systemctl start avahi-daemon
Hostname.local can't be resolved by other hosts
	- avahi packages needs installed - still doesn't work
	- The above firewall configuration
	- Still doesn't work - see starting service above
Hostname is set to fedora - there is nothing in /etc/hostname
	- Can be set by:
		1. hostnamectl - sets transient hostname and /etc/hostname
		2. hostname - only sets transient hostname
		3. /etc/hostname
Console scrollback doesn't work
