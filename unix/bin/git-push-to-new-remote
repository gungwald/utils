# This is needed when you have finished development on a new feature branch
# locally and you need to push it to a remote system like github for the first
# time. The branch exists locally but not in the remote system yet. This
# command pushes to the remote, creates the remote branch with the same name,
# and sets up the remote branch as the default push target.

BRANCH_NAME=`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` # Get name of local branch
git push -u origin "$BRANCH_NAME"               # Create remote with same name
