# From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3618078/pipe-only-stderr-through-a-filter
#
# The following redirections allow stderr to be piped through a filter but
# not stdout:
#
#   3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 3>&-
#
# Explanation:
# 1. First save stdout as &3 (&1 is duped into 3)
# 2. Next send stdout to stderr (&2 is duped into 1)
# 3. Send stderr to &3 (stdout) (&3 is duped into 2)
# 4. close &3 (&- is duped into 3)

# So stderr gets piped through "tail" but stdout does not.

exec "$JAVA6" "$@" 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 3>&- | tail -n +3
