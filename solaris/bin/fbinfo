DATE=98/03/02

##	@(#) fbinfo 1.2.9
##	Written by Dave Tong, SunSoft, March 1996
##
##	This version recognises AFB.
##	It also uses ffbconfig and afbconfig (if available)
##	to ensure that the resolution information displayed is correct.
##
##	Please send feedback to fbinfo@skaro.eng.sun.com
##
##	Download the latest version of this program from
##		http://sunsolve.uk/FAQ/fbinfo
##	or	http://c3-a.snvl1.sfba.home.com/fbinfo

##	DEFICIENCIES
##
##	Information about PGX and other PCI based cards is incomplete
##	Information about 3rd party graphics cards is incomplete
##	No information about FFB2+ and beyond
##	No information about Vertical AFB
##	No information about Ultra 5 on board frame buffer

##	KNOWN BUGS:
##
##	TZX:	It's not possible to distinguish a TZX from a ZX,
##			as prtconf reports the model incorrectly
##	GX:		Certain early boards don't report the rev number.
##
##	Also the screen resolution reported is that set at boot time; this is
##	not necessarily the current resolution in the case of some devices.

#	Temporary files

PRTCONF="/tmp/prtconf.$$"
THISFB="/tmp/janus.$$"

#	Need to get at arch, prtconf/devinfo etc.
