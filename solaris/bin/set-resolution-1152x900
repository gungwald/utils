# http://www.sunhelp.org/faq/FrameBuffer.html says the eeprom
# command doesn't work with the PGX graphics card. But I think
# it did work. The m64config command should be used instead.

# This command is very informative: m64config -res '?'

# To print current value: sudo eeprom output-device

# To set default value: sudo eeprom output-device=screen

# The last number is the refresh rate.
