/*  dos2unix.js 
        
        - Converts a text file from DOS to UNIX format
        - Implements in Windows the dos2unix command found on Linux & BSD UNIX
        - Will conform to behavior of UNIX command for operational efficiency
        - Runs "out of the box" on Windows, requiring no additional components
        - Usage: dos2unix <filenames>

 * The DOS/Windows text file format has a carriage return character
 * (ASCII code 13) and a line feed character (ASCII code 10) at the end
 * of each line. This is sometimes abbreviated as CRLF.

 * The UNIX text file format has only a line feed (a.k.a. new line 
 * character) at the end of each line.
