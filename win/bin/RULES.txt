1. JScript execution requires a .bat here and a .js in the scripts directory
   because command line programs need to run with cscript, not wscript,
   which is the default. Or the .js can include code to restart itself with
   cscript.
2. Windows-specific Perl .pl files can go here because windows can be 
   configured to execute them directly.
3. Any Java programs should go in ~/git/utils/java, not here in the Windows
   directory, unless they are Windows-specific.
