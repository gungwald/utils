# Adds NVidia proprietary firmware to provide acceleration on
# Dell Precision M6300 with NVidia G84GLM [Quadro FX 1600M] (rev a1)
# - Recognized by Linux as nv84_xuc00f in dmesg
# - NV proprietary driver doesn't support this GPU anymore?
# For the M6300, this fixes Gnome on Wayland but breaks it on X
# This doesn't really apply to any other machine I have. It would
# only work on a machine with an older NVidia GPU
