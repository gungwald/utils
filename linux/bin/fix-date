# The standard tool used to get/set the hardware clock is /sbin/hwclock.
# But, for some reason this does not work on the PowerBook G4 hardware.
# The /sbin/clock program from powerpc-utils needs to be used. This
# work is done on boot time in /etc/init.d/hwclock.sh.

# To work around put this in /etc/rc.local and enable the execute bits:
# if /sbin/clock -au
# then
#     echo Date transferred from CMOS to system as: `date`
# else
#     echo Could not get date from CMOS.
# fi
# This never seems to get run.

# Somehow the clock is getting set right when I don't do a
# Shift-Ctrl-Alt-Power to reset the PMU. I don't understand
# how it is working. It might be my /etc/rc.local script but
# I can't find any evidence that it is running.
